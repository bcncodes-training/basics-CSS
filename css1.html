            <h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
            <p>I have a cat, and am thinking of getting a dog. Will they fight?</p>
            <p>The idea that dogs hate cats may have been born because dogs chase cats and grew because cartoons
                depicted
                ongoing battles between the two species. Or it may have been generated because some dog people strongly
                dislike
                cats and some cat people disdain dogs. However, dog and cats can live peaceably as long as owners
                understand the
                behaviors of each.</p>
            <p>In some cases, a resident cat Will isolate itself when a puppy is added to the fam√ºy_ In other cases,
                cats and
                dogs never get used to each other _ In still other cases, cat or kitten and dog or puppy play togethe
                and build
                a friendship that finds them curled up together in a crate or bed and drinking out of the same bowl. The
                type of
                relationship developed in each household depends on the personality of the and the understanding of the
                owners.

        <div>
            <h1>Metaphor</h1>
            <p>A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For example, moo is to cow as beep is to car. These
                mappings get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their effects.</p>
            <p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:
                <ul>
                    <li>"He shot down her ideas."</li>
                    <li>"She defended her position."</li>
                    <li>"She overwhelmed his arguments."</li>
                    <li>"He had to retreat from that position."</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These are all debate-as-war metaphors. It's a zero sum game. Someone wins and someone loses. The idea
                that both people could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</p>

            <h1>Studying Advice</h1>
            <p> Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</br>
                Always study in the same place?</br>
                <span>Wrong!</span></br>
                Study one topic intensively before going on to the next?</br>
                <span>Wrong!</span></br>
                Here are some study tips that are based on <span>actual research.</span></br>
                <span>From <i>Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits</i>, by Benedict Carey, published in the
                    <i>New York Times</i> on September 6, 2010.</span>

            <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
            Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ... Varying the place you study helps you remember
            more.
            <h2>Mix content</h2>
            Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember
            more.
            <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
            Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session.
            <h2>Self-testing</h2>
            <p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how wel you know.
                CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.</p>
