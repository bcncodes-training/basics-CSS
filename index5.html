            <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
            <p>
                Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room,... Varying the place you study helps tou remember more.
            </p>

            <h2>Mix content</h2>
            <p>
                Study a bit of this, abit of that, some this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember more.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
            <p>
                Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session.
            </p>

            <h2>Self-testing</h2>
            <p>
                Test yorself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.
                <br /><br />
